# AthleteMonitoring
The current program consists of three code pieces  
Athlete_Monitoring.py - Dash GUI/graph ploting  
Data_processing.py - Creation of a dataframe from given data  
position_generator.py - Creates a set of trainingsdata currently used for Data_processing.py

Currently file paths are hardcoded to accept npy files, which need to be placed in \AthleteMonitoring\Athlete_Monitoring_python\Plotly_Projekt\Data
